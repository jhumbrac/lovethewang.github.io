    <h1>My Mission</h1>

    <p>I’m a Operations Manager, living in San Francisco, CA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I became frustrated at my current start-up not having any direct interaction with our product. </p>

    <h2>My Mission!</h2>
    
    <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Product Manager, because I’d like to work in an environment where the products I build are intuitive and improve people’s lives!</p>
